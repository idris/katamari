Building and Running
====================
To use the program using the provided katamari.exe file, simply run the 
program, but make sure the objects.txt and skybox-clouds.bmp files are in the 
same directory as katamari.exe.

To build and run with Visual C++ Express, build as normal, but again make sure 
the above files are in the build directory, or the directory with the exe file.


Katamari Controls
=================
The katamari is controlled by the keyboard. Press the arrow keys to "push" the 
katamari (up/down/left/right).

To speed up or slow down animation, press + or -


Camera Controls
===============
The camera always follows the katamari, but you can control its position using 
the keyboard as follows:
'e' - increase the camera angle (camera will move to the right)
'r' - decrease the camera angle (camera will move to the left)
'd' - move the camera up
'f' - move the camera down
'c' - zoom out
'v' - zoom in
